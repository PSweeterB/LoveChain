# LoveChain
There is tradition in many countries to put locks on bridges as a sign of everlasting love.
But in reality it is not as permanent as lovers wants. After some period of time this locks cuts off by authorities.
To prevent this I made LoveChain smart contract to make thous signs of love truly permanent by putting them into blockchain.
